		<p>
		To be, or not to be--that is the question:
		Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
		The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
		Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
		And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep--
		No more--and by a sleep to say we end
		The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
		That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
		Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--
		To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,
		For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
		When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
		Must give us pause. There's the respect
		That makes calamity of so long life.
		For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
		Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely
		The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
		The insolence of office, and the spurns
		That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
		When he himself might his quietus make
		With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
		To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
		But that the dread of something after death,
		The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
		No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
		And makes us rather bear those ills we have
		Than fly to others that we know not of?
		Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
		And thus the native hue of resolution
		Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
		And enterprise of great pitch and moment
		With this regard their currents turn awry
		And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now,
		The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons
		Be all my sins remembered.

		<p>
		Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
		Or close the wall up with our English dead.
		In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
		As modest stillness and humility: 
		But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
		Then imitate the action of the tiger;
		Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
		Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
		Then lend the eye a terrible aspect; 
		Let pry through the portage of the head
		Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
		As fearfully as doth a galled rock
		O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
		Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean. 
		Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
		Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
		To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.
		Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
		Fathers that, like so many Alexanders, 
		Have in these parts from morn till even fought
		And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
		Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
		That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
		Be copy now to men of grosser blood, 
		And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,
		Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
		The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
		That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
		For there is none of you so mean and base, 
		That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
		I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
		Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
		Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
		Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'

		<p>
		If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
		It were done quickly: if the assassination
		Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
		With his surcease success; that but this blow
		Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
		But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
		We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases 
		We still have judgment here; that we but teach
		Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
		To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
		Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
		To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
		First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
		Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
		Who should against his murderer shut the door,
		Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
		Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been 
		So clear in his great office, that his virtues
		Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
		The deep damnation of his taking-off;
		And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
		Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed 
		Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
		Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
		That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
		To prick the sides of my intent, but only
		Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself 
		And falls on the other.
