			To be, or not to be--that is the question:
			Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
			The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
			Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
			And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep--
			No more--and by a sleep to say we end
			The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
			That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
			Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--
			To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,
			For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
			When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
			Must give us pause. There's the respect
			That makes calamity of so long life.
			For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
			Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely
			The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
			The insolence of office, and the spurns
			That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
			When he himself might his quietus make
			With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
			To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
			But that the dread of something after death,
			The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
			No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
			And makes us rather bear those ills we have
			Than fly to others that we know not of?
			Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
			And thus the native hue of resolution
			Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
			And enterprise of great pitch and moment
			With this regard their currents turn awry
			And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now,
			The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons
			Be all my sins remembered.</p>

			Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
			Or close the wall up with our English dead.
			In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
			As modest stillness and humility: 
			But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
			Then imitate the action of the tiger;
			Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
			Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
			Then lend the eye a terrible aspect; 
			Let pry through the portage of the head
			Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
			As fearfully as doth a galled rock
			O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
			Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean. 
			Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
			Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
			To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.
			Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
			Fathers that, like so many Alexanders, 
			Have in these parts from morn till even fought
			And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
			Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
			That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
			Be copy now to men of grosser blood, 
			And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,
			Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
			The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
			That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
			For there is none of you so mean and base, 
			That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
			I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
			Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
			Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
			Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'</p>

			If we shadows have offended,
			Think but this, and all is mended,
			That you have but slumber'd here
			While these visions did appear.
			And this weak and idle theme,
			No more yielding but a dream,
			Gentles, do not reprehend:
			if you pardon, we will mend:
			And, as I am an honest Puck,
			If we have unearned luck
			Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
			We will make amends ere long;
			Else the Puck a liar call;
			So, good night unto you all.
			Give me your hands, if we be friends,
			And Robin shall restore amends.</p>
